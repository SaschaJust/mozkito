/**
 * 
 * A strategy determines the way reposuite decides whether a mapping is valid or
 * not. In a TotalAgreement strategy all engines have to agree on a valid
 * mapping.
 * 
 * Reposuite relies on a strategy to be used when computing the actual mappings.
 * In this step, reposuite fetches all MapScores from the previous step from the
 * persistence provider and evaluates the feature vector according to the
 * selected strategy. E.g. if a TotalConfidence strategy is used, reposuite will
 * only consider mappings as valid, if and only if the total confidence (the sum
 * of all individual scores from the engines) yields a positive result. In a
 * veto strategies, all mappings that have at least one negative value in the
 * feature vector are dropped. Certain strategies rely on storages. E.g. the SVM
 * strategy uses a model that has been build beforehand by having a support
 * vector machine train on already mapped and verified data. If a mapping has
 * passed the strategy checks it is persisted in the database.
