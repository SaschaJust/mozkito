/**
 * 
 * A strategy determines the way reposuite decides whether a mapping is valid or not. In a TotalAgreement strategy all
 * engines have to agree on a valid mapping.
 * 
 * Reposuite relies on a strategy to be used when computing the actual mappings. In this step, reposuite fetches all
 * MapScores from the previous step from the persistence provider and evaluates the feature vector according to the
 * selected strategy. E.g. if a TotalConfidence strategy is used, reposuite will only consider mappings as valid, if and
 * only if the total confidence (the sum of all individual scores from the engines) yields a positive result. In a veto
 * strategies, all mappings that have at least one negative value in the feature vector are dropped. Certain strategies
 * rely on storages. E.g. the SVM strategy uses a model that has been build beforehand by having a support vector
 * machine train on already mapped and verified data. If a mapping has passed the strategy checks it is persisted in the
 * database.
